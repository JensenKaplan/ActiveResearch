# Susceptibility
Magnetic susceptibility is indirectly measured by the PPMS-VSM. We perform Field Cooling (FC) and Zero-Field Cooling (ZFC) measurements of the magnetic moment over a range of temperatures; for FC we usually apply a constant .1T field. The moment is in units of (emu), the applied field is in the units of (Oe), and temperature is in (K).

## Normalization and Unit Conversion
Although measurements are made in emu/Oe we prefer to look at susceptibility data in units of uB/T. We also normalize our data per mol, this allows us to gain intuition for what values we should expect for other compounds in the series. PCF produces susceptibility data in units of uB/T/spin; so for comparing theory and experiment I normalize the data per spin (of the magnetic central ion).

M<sub>uB</sub> = M<sub>emu</sub> / 9.274e-21

H<sub>T</sub> = H<sub>Oe</sub> / 10,000

## Current Issue
PCF susceptibility is producing results orders of magnitude greater than measured. Also, using PCF magnetization and manually doing M/H doesn't produce susceptibility that matches the susceptibility function. Although, the effective moment of the measured Sr2PrO4 is reasonable for the system....
