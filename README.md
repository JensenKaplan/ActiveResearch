# WELCOME
This GitHub is a showcase of code that I've written and used during the ongoing course of my PhD program at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
As a condensed matter experimentalist I explore quantum magnetism in frusatrated lattice systems, with Lanthanides as the central ion. (I study crystals).

## What's in this Git?
Here you'll find Jupyter notebooks I've created that I regularly use to carry out my research. They will be complete and ready to run as-is, carrying out statistical analysis on the associated data files.

## What types of measurements do I use?
There are some common measurements we use to characterize our crystalline systems:

### QuantumDesign PPMS Dynacool with Vibrating Sample Magnetometer
1. Magnetization (M vs H) measured at different temperatures.
2. Susceptibility (M vs T) Field Cooling / Zero Field Cooling (with an applied .01T magnetic field)
### OakRidge National Lab (ORNL) Neutron Beamlines
1. Inelastic Neutron Scattering

## What do I do with the measured data?
1. Thermodynamic (M vs T) data as measured by the PPMS is analyzed to find the Curie and Weiss constants. The Weiss Constant give us insight into the ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic nature exhibited by our systems. The Curie Constant is used to calculate the effective magnetic moment of our system.
2. Thermodynamic (M vs H) data as measured by the PPMS is analyzed to find saturation points of my compounds.
3. Neutron data is analyzed to find low lying (in energy) magnetic modes in our systems. Analysis is carried out to determine the Crystal Electric Field Hamiltonian.
