## The Cubic Crystal Field Hamiltonian
Cubic symmetry allows for a simple Crystal Field Hamiltonian which consists of only 2 independent terms.
H<sub>CUB<sub>= B<sub>4(O<sub>4<sup>0)

## Cubic Grid Creation
Create_Grid.py is used to create .mat files that contain the eigenvalues calculated by PCF, enforcing cubic constraints, for all (x,bpf).
